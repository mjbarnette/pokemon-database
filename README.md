# pokemon-database
A Java-based Pokémon data application designed to explore relational database design, JDBC, and Spring Data JPA, with an emphasis on clean layering and data-access best practices.

# Pokémon Database Project

## Overview
A Java-based Pokémon data application designed to explore relational database
design, JDBC-based DAOs, and Spring Data JPA while applying proper layered architecture.

## Technologies
- Java
- PostgreSQL
- JDBC
- Spring Data JPA (planned)

## Architecture
- DAO layer for database access
- Service layer for business logic
- UI layer for user interaction

## Learning Objectives
- Design normalized relational schemas
- Implement DAOs using JDBC
- Compare manual SQL with Spring Data JPA
- Understand separation of concerns

## Future Work
- Migrate DAOs to Spring Data JPA
- Add search and filtering features
